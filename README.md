# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [Razorpay]('https://razorpay.com/docs/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/')
